# Project name

A short introduction to your project could go here. This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Grow website.

## Prerequisites

At a minimum, you will need the following tools installed:

1. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. [Grow](https://grow.io)

If you do not have Grow, you can install it using:

```
curl https://install.growsdk.org | bash
```

## Running the development server

Prior to starting the development server, you may have to install dependencies used by your project. The `grow install` command walks you through this and tries to set up your environment for you.

The `grow run` command starts your development server. You can make changes to your project files and refresh to see them reflected immediately.

```
grow install
grow run
```

## Building

You can use the `grow build` command to build your whole site to the `build` directory. This is a good way to test and verify the generated code.

```
grow build
```

## Staging

Once you are ready to share your changes with your team, you can stage your workspace to an access-controlled web server. Running the below command will build your site and deploy it, and then provide you with a link to the staging environment.

```
grow stage
```
